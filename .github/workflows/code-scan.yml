    # Scan runs on ubuntu, mac and windows

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    # Instructions
    # 1. Setup JDK, Node.js, Python etc depending on your project type
    # 2. Compile or build the project before invoking scan
    #    Example: mvn compile, or npm install or pip install goes here
    # 3. Invoke Scan with the github token. Leave the workspace empty to use relative url
